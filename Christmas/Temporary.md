Lesson 20 1/11 : John Baptist / Baptism
    
Theme:    BAPTISM: John the Baptist and Sacraments
*** Hang up photos and dove worksheet on bulletin board
Say: “Last week, we talked about the symbol of light. Today, we talk about baptism, which uses symbols. Baptism and Communion are 2 sacraments. A sacrament is a ritual - a symbolic thing people do at church - to remember Jesus. Baptism is the sacrament of how people become Christians.” 
 	Ask- does anyone know what happens at baptism, and who gets baptized? 
Say - “What happens is that the pastor will put water on your head, and say, “I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit”. A lot of people are baptized as babies, but anyone joining the church can be baptized. You are only baptized once. Sometimes people have godparents, or sponsors. In the Service of Christian Baptism, WATER stands for the promise of the gift of God’s grace in our lives and being flooded with the new life that is experienced through Jesus Christ” (This last sentence comes directly from Seekonk UCC)
Ask: “What does it mean to be a follower of Jesus, that we discussed from last week?”
Answers: Following the Golden Rule of treating others as you would treat them, and showing compassion to the less fortunate.

In Jesus’ time, there were no Christians! Baptism was performed on Jewish adults who followed a prophet named John the Baptist. A prophet is someone who gives God’s message. The followers of John the Baptist were waiting for the coming of the Messiah (Jesus), a savior who would make the world a better place. Even Jesus was baptized by John.
