## Lesson: Jesus is Tempted in the Desert/ Listening to your conscience
- **Theme:** Listen to your conscience, even under peer pressure
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - By the end of the class, students will be able to define `conscience` in their own words, give 2 strategies for resisting `peer pressure`, and discuss 2 ways to grow the conscience.
- **Context / Purpose:** "Developing Moral Identity"
   - [Greater Good](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/four_ways_teachers_can_help_students_develop_a_conscience)
 "As a child more and more successfully embraces rules and avoids misbehavior, and develops empathy and compassion toward others, he starts to consider himself a moral person. This may in turn predict good behavior. One study found that five year olds who described themselves as very moral exhibited strong prosocial skills almost two years later. Other research has found that students with strong moral identities are more motivated to behave prosocially—sharing, helping, and comforting others—even when they don’t get any recognition for it. That’s conscience in action."
- **Opening (Say):**
  > Today we're going to learn about what your conscience is, what peer pressure is, and what temptation is. When the Bible was written, people believed that a bad angel called the devil tempted people to do bad things. In the Bible story today, that imagery was used to tell a story. Today, we don't talk about bad angels. We believe that if you practice making good decisions, then it will be easier to make those good decisions when its tempting not to. `Lent` is 40 days (not counting Sundays) to represent the 40 days that Jesus spent in the desert.
- **Scripture / Read:** The Temptations in the Wilderness, page 204.
  > Ask the children if they have any questions.
  > Ask if anyone knows what temptation means.
- **Read**: `Facing Peer Pressure` by Golriz Golkar (World Book: Facing Life's Challenges).
  - Ask the children if they know the term `conscience`.
- **Key questions / Discussion points:**
   - Discuss `conscience`, the peer pressure book, and the story of Jesus.
   - How do you know when you haven't listend to your conscience? How did that make you feel? How did that end up making others feel?
   - Was there ever a time it was hard to do the right thing? What are 2 ways to resist peer pressure?
   - How can you grow your conscience? Have the kids think of a few examples.
     > Practicing the Golden Rule, being patient, etc. 
   - Do you think you need to take care of conscience, just like you have to take care of your body and mind? Why is that important?
     > Concrete reasons why its important to develop your conscience - it will help you interact better with other people, which will make yourself and the other person happier.
     > Listening to your conscience can help keep you safe and healthy, and it will help you make positive decisions.
  - Do the `Try This` section in the `Goals and Tools` section (page 22) of `Facing Peer Pressure`.
- **Materials / Supplies:** N/A
- **Activities (step-by-step):** Play the `Mercy Wheel` again.
- **Teacher notes / Tips:**  `Please **do not** teach there is a literal devil`.
   -  Some people will believe in one, and some people don't. But its a scary topic that could give children a complex, so its good to avoid this topic.
   -  During peer pressure conversations, if bullying or harm comes up during the conversation, please tell the parents and religious education.
-  Also please avoid terms and discussion of things like `demon`, or things like `K Pop Demon Hunters`. This is so that kids don't get confused about serious topics with entertainment. The term `Bad angel` was chosen for a reason.
- **Passport Location:** The Judean Wilderness (the desert)
- **Resources / Books / Handouts:**   
- **TODOs / follow-up:** Get the `Peer Pressure` book from the library
- **Assessment / Closing:** 
- **Home connection / Family activity:** Conversation starters for parents: “What would your conscience say about…?” or “Tell me about a time you were proud of the choice you made.”



Closing Prayer   
Dear God,

Please Bless all of us this week and keep us safe.
