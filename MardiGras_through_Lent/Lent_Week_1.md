## Lesson: Jesus is Tempted in the Desert/ Listening to your conscience
- **Theme:** Listen to your conscience, even under peer pressure
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - Fill in concrete objectives (eg, students will be able to tell you 3 out of 14 works of mercy). 
- **Context / Purpose:**
- [Greater Good](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/four_ways_teachers_can_help_students_develop_a_conscience)
 "As a child more and more successfully embraces rules and avoids misbehavior, and develops empathy and compassion toward others, he starts to consider himself a moral person. This may in turn predict good behavior. One study found that five year olds who described themselves as very moral exhibited strong prosocial skills almost two years later. Other research has found that students with strong moral identities are more motivated to behave prosocially—sharing, helping, and comforting others—even when they don’t get any recognition for it. That’s conscience in action."

- **Opening (Say):**
  > Today we're going to learn about what your conscience is, what peer pressure is, and what temptation is. When the Bible was written, people believed that a bad angel called the devil tempted people to do bad things. In the Bible story today, that imagery was used to tell a story. Today, we don't talk about bad angels. We believe that if you practice making good decisions, then it will be easier to make those good decisions when its tempting not to. `Lent` is 40 days (not counting Sundays) to represent the 40 days that Jesus spent in the desert.
- **Scripture / Read:** The Temptations in the Wilderness, page 204.
  > Ask the children if they have any questions.
- **Read**: `Facing Peer Pressure` by Golriz Golkar (World Book: Facing Life's Challenges).
  > Ask the children if they know the term `conscience`.
- Discuss `conscience`, the peer book, and the story of Jesus.
- Discuss how your conscience gets formed the right way. eg: practicing the `Golden Rule`.
- **Key questions / Discussion points:**  
   - How do you know when you haven't listend to your conscience? How did that make you feel? How did that end up making others feel?
   - Was there ever a time it was hard to do the right thing?
   - How can you grow your conscience? Do you think you need to take care of conscience, just like you have to take care of your body and mind? Why is that important?
     > Concrete reasons why its important to develop your conscience - it will help you interact better with other people, which will make yourself and the other person happier. 
- **Materials / Supplies:** 
- **Activities (step-by-step):** 
   - Delineate activity steps
- **Teacher notes / Tips:**  `Please do not teach there is a literal devil`. Some people will believe in one, and some people don't. But its a scary topic that could give children a complex.
