## Lesson: Jesus is Tempted in the Desert/ Listening to your conscience
- **Theme:** Listen to your conscience, even under peer pressure
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - Fill in concrete objectives (eg, students will be able to tell you 3 out of 14 works of mercy). 
- **Context / Purpose:** 
- **Opening (Say):**
  > Today we're going to learn about what your conscience is, what peer pressure is, and what temptation is. When the Bible was written, people believed that a bad angel called the devil tempted people to do bad things. In the Bible story today, that imagery was used to tell a story. Today, we don't talk about bad angels. We believe that if you practice making good decisions, then it will be easier to make those good decisions when its tempting not to. `Lent` is 40 days (not counting Sundays) to represent the 40 days that Jesus spent in the desert.
- **Scripture / Read:** The Temptations in the Wilderness, page 204.
  > Ask the children if they have any questions.
- **Read**: `Facing Peer Pressure` by Golriz Golkar (World Book: Facing Life's Challenges).
  > Ask the children if they know the term `conscience`.
- Discuss `conscience`, the peer book, and the story of Jesus.
