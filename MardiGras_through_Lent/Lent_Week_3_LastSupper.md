## Lesson: The Lord's Supper and Communion / Clay Chalices
- **Theme:** The Lord's Supper / Communion / Remembering Jesus
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - Fill in concrete objectives (eg, students will be able to tell you 3 out of 14 works of mercy). 
- **Context / Purpose:** 
- **Opening (Say):**
  > Every Sunday, in our church, we have what is called `Communion`. During `Communion`, we receive bread dipped in juice. The bread and juice represent the body and blood of Jesus. This is a way that we remember Jesus. It's something that most Christian churches do, sometimes every week or sometimes once a month. Some churches use wine. Jesus told us to remember him in this way during the last `Passover` sedar he celebrated before he was crucified. We will now read that story. One thing you need to know before we read this story is that one of Jesus` disciples, Judas Iscariot, made a deal with the leaders to betray Jesus. The other thing you need to know is that we use juice, but Jesus used wine.
