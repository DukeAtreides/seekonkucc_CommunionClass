## Lesson: The Passover and Sedar
- **Theme:** We all have traditions, but not all people have the same traditions.
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - Children will be able to name 3 elements of the Passover story and Sedar meal
- **Context / Purpose:** 
- **Opening (Say):**
  > Jesus was not Christian. He was `Jewish`. He celebrated all the stories and celebrations of the `Jewish` people. 1500 years before Jesus lived, there lived a Hebrew man named Moses. Hebrew is what the Jewish people were called in very ancient times. You learned a little bit about Moses earlier in the year. But to refresh, in the time of Moses, the Hebrew people were `slaves` in Egypt. A slave is someone who is forced to work for someone else. With God's help, Moses lead his people to freedom. This is the story of the `Passover`. Each spring, the Jewish people celebrate a `Sedar` meal to remember this story. Jesus also celebrated the `Sedar` meal to remember the `Passover` event.

- **Key questions / Discussion points:**  
   - Is there anything you didn't understand?
   - Christians don't celebrate Passover. We celebrate Easter at around the same time.  How are traditions that other people celebrate similar to what we celebrate? How are they different?
   - How do traditions keep our memories alive of past times? Do you have family traditions at Easter or Christmas. Do you hear older family members telling stories of those holidays that happened a long time ago?
   - Why are family traditions important?
