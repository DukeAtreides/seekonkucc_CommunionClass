## Lesson: Jesus Before Pilate / Bullying
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - Learn about not teasing others
  - Learn about what to do when being teased
  - Learn about standing up for others
  - Learn about not judging others, especially with incomplete information.
- **Context / Purpose:** Jesus' trial is used as a starting point to discuss the kinds of "trials" kids go through at home with siblings and in school.
- **Opening (Say):** 
  > In Jesus' time, the Roman Empire ruled many lands, including the land of Judea, where Jesus lived. The Roman official in charge was named Pontius Pilate. We know from other books of the time, that Pontius Pilate was espcially mean and cruel. In the story we are reading today, Pontius Pilate is judging Jesus at a place called the `Praetorium`. He will ultimately sentence him to be crucified.
- **Scripture / Read:** Read: Jesus Before Pilate,The Children’s Illustrated Bible, page 272 -273
- ** Read: **  `Turn Away from Teasing. By Gill Hasson. A Kids Can Cope book.`
- **Key questions / Discussion points:**  
   - Discuss how teasing and bullying feels.
   - Discuss how it can be harmful to judge other people, especially when you don't know anything about that.
- **Materials / Supplies:** Paper, markers
- **Activities (step-by-step):** Do the activities in the back of the `Turn Away From Teasing` book. 
- **Teacher notes / Tips:**
  > "And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
  > Had his moment of doubt and pain
  > Made damn sure that Pilate
  > Washed his hands and sealed his fate"
  - If you don't know the song, you should look it up. It's a classic.
