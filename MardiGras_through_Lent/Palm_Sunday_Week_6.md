Opening Prayer: pass offering basket, light candle (battery operated) 
Repeat Prayer:  
Dear God, 
We are thankful we are gathered here today. 
Be with us as we learn more about Jesus. 
When we share bread together we will think of our Jesus. 
Forgive us when we are not kind or helpful.
Help me God to spread Your Love around 
In Jesus name we pray -  Amen 

## Lesson: Palm Sunday
- **Learning objectives:**
- **Context / Purpose:** 
- The kids will be singing in the choir at the beginning, and then going to wave Palms at the end.
- ** Opening **:
   > Remember from the Easter story, when Jesus rode into Jersalem on a donkey, and everyone cheered?
   > Today, is Palm Sunday. We remember that story today. We use palms because the people put palms in front of Jesus when he rode in.
- ** Collect ** the sayings of Jesus assigned from last week.
- **Materials / Supplies:** Poster board, markers, stencils, rulers
- **Activities (step-by-step):** Make the Keyword Poster (Part 2) 
   - If possible, finish the poster.
   - This serves as a review of keywords already covered (or some that will be covered later in the curriculum)
   - Use stencils to fill the poster board with keywords.
   - Kids will take turns drawing on the stencils. When possible, could work at the same time. But the idea is to make sure each kid can have a turn drawing the letters.
     > Put `Love` in the biggest letters in the middle
     > Put `Empathy` and `Compassion` in the biggest letters (either top/bottom across or on the sides going downwards).
     > Put other words from the [keyword review sheet](https://github.com/DukeAtreides/seekonkucc_CommunionClass/blob/main/Handouts/Keywords.md)
     > Review the meaning of the words and think of examples as the kids are making the poster.
   - Color the letters if there is time. If not, there's always next week.

- **Teacher notes / Tips:** If the poster doesn't get finished, we'll just work on it in subsequent weeks.

- **Passport Location:** 
- **TODOs / follow-up:** 
- **Assessment / Closing:** 
- **Home connection / Family activity:**


Closing Prayer   
Dear God,  
As we leave our gathering space today, 
Please Bless all of us this week and keep us safe. 
Amen
