## Lesson: The Prodigal Son / Forgiveness

### Theme
God’s welcome and forgiveness; mercy is greater than fairness.

### Learning Objectives
- Retell the Prodigal Son story in three main parts (leave, realize, return) with 80% accuracy.
- Define the word **parable** in their own words and give one example.
- Identify one way the father showed forgiveness and one way we can show forgiveness at home or school.
- Create a simple “Welcome Home” card or banner that expresses forgiveness or welcome.

### Context / Purpose
- Use during Lent, a unit on Jesus’ parables, or a session about forgiveness and reconciliation.
- Reading: Children’s Bible, pages 240–241 (Luke 15:11–32).

## Opening (Say)
> Every Sunday in our church we gather to learn about Jesus and to remember how he taught people to love one another. Today we will read a story Jesus told called the Prodigal Son. First, a new word: a **parable** is a short story, like a fable, Jesus used to teach about God. Parables use everyday things to help us understand big ideas like love, forgiveness, and kindness.

---

## Define “Parable”
- **Definition:** A parable is a short story Jesus told using ordinary people or things to teach a spiritual truth.
- **Explain:** Parables are not always meant to be taken as exact real-life events; they are like pictures or examples that help us understand how God feels and acts. The Prodigal Son is a parable that helps us see how much God celebrates when someone comes back to God.

---

## Scripture / Read
- Read aloud: Children’s Bible, pages 240–241.
- Use expressive voices; pause on key moments (leaving, need, decision to return, father’s welcome).
- Suggested read timing: ~8–10 minutes including brief pauses for comprehension.

---

## Key Questions / Discussion Points
- Who left home and why? What happened after he left?
- How did the younger son change his mind?
- What did the father do when he saw his son coming back? Why is that surprising?
- How did the older brother feel? Why might someone feel that way?
- What does this story teach us about God? About how we should treat others?
- Wrap-up main idea: God forgives and rejoices when we come back; forgiveness is about love more than fairness.

## Materials / Supplies
- Simple costume pieces for role-play (scarves, headbands, small robes)
- Construction paper, crayons/markers, stickers, glue, yarn (for banner/cards)
- Printed sequencing sheet (4 boxes) or plain paper for drawing
- Optional: small snack for celebration (if permitted)

## Activity

### 1) Role-play / Skit (15 min)
Handout: [Prodigal Son Script](https://github.com/DukeAtreides/seekonkucc_CommunionClass/blob/main/Handouts/ProdigalSonPlay.md)
- Assign roles: father, younger son, older brother, narrator, servants.
- Narrator briefly summarizes scenes while actors pantomime:
  - Leaving home
  - Wasting money (narrated)
  - Decision to return
  - Father running to welcome
  - Party
- Debrief: Ask actors how each person might have felt.

### 2) “Welcome Home” Banner or Card (15 min)
- Each child makes a small banner or card that says “Welcome Home” or “I Forgive You.”
- Encourage drawings showing welcome actions (open arms, hug, cake, party).

---

## Optional Active Game: Forgiveness Tag (5–10 min)
- One child is “angry.”
- If tagged by someone who says “I forgive you,” they switch roles.
- Keep rounds short and supervised; emphasize words and kind actions.

---

## Teacher Notes / Tips
- **Age adjustments:**
- Keep language concrete; focus on feelings and the father’s welcome. Shorter activities, more drawing.
- Discuss the older brother’s perspective, fairness vs. mercy, and connect to other “lost” parables (Lost Sheep, Lost Coin).
- **Sensitivity:** Some children’s family situations may mirror parts of the story. Avoid emphasizing family abandonment; focus on God’s love and safety. Offer children the option to observe rather than role-play.
- **Pacing:** Keep total session 30–45 minutes. Limit role-play time if group is large.
- Reinforce vocabulary: Have kids repeat “parable” and the one-sentence paraphrase of the story.

---

## Assessment / Closing
- Quick checks:
  - Ask two volunteers to retell the story in one sentence each.
  - Ask each child to name one way they can show forgiveness this week.
  - Collect the sequencing drawings to assess comprehension.
- Closing prayer:
  > Dear God, thank you for your love and for forgiving us. Help us to welcome others and forgive like you do. Amen.

---

## Home Connection / Family Activity
- Suggest parents praise the child for retelling and practicing forgiveness during Lent.
