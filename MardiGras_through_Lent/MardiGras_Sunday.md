## Lesson: Works of Mercy and Sacrifice
- **Theme:** Works of Mercy and Sacrifice
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - By the end of class, students will be able to name at least three `Corporal Works of Mercy` and two `Spiritual Works of Mercy`, and commit to one simple Lenten sacrifice they can do at home.
- **Context / Purpose:** This is a preparation for Lent and the importance of sacrifice.
- **Opening (Say):**
  > “Today we’re going to learn how we can help others even when we can’t do big miracles — we can show mercy and make small sacrifices.”
- **Scripture / Read:** Distribute and discuss the [Works of Mercy Handout](https://github.com/DukeAtreides/seekonkucc_CommunionClass/blob/main/Handouts/Works_of_Mercy.md)
- **Key questions / Discussion points:**  
   - What are ways you can do the works of mercy?
   - What are ways you can make sacrifices?
- **Materials / Supplies:** Paper plate, card board, long tooth pick
- **Activities (step-by-step):** Make and Play the Mercy Wheel
   - Make the Mercy wheel.
   - First, take the paper plate. Divide into 8 regions.
   - Select 8 `Acts of Mercy`. Choose at least 3 `corporal`, 2 `spiritual`, and 1 `Methodist`.
   - Write each `Act of Mercy` in each region.
   - Attach the spinner to the tooth pick.
   - The teacher will punch out a small hole in the center and insert the wooden tooth pick.
   - `Play` it by spinning and role playing scenarios.
   - The student will spin the wheel.
   - The teacher will be the person in need according to the wheel.
   - The student will then act out the act of mercy according to the wheel.
- **Teacher notes / Tips:**  
- **Passport Location:** New Orleans (explain `Mardi Gras` before leaving)
- **Resources / Books / Handouts:**   
- **TODOs / follow-up:** Make enough copies of the handout for each student.
- **Assessment / Closing:** Before we enter into Lent though, we have a big celebration called `Mardi Gras`. We'll be having that celebration in the hall after class!!! A place known for Mardi Gras is New Orleans Louisana, where they eat `cajun` like gumbo.
- **Home connection / Family activity:** Encourage families to talk about a Lenten sacrifice or making new habits.




Closing Prayer   
Dear God,  
As we leave our gathering space today, 
Please Bless all of us this week and keep us safe. 
Amen
