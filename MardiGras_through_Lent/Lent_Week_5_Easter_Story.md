Dear God,

When we share bread together we will think of our Jesus. 
Forgive us when we are not kind or helpful.

## Lesson: The Easter Story / Empathy
- **Learning objectives:**
  - Learn the Easter story
  - Learn about empathy, love, compassion
- **Context / Purpose:** 
- **Opening (Say):** 
  > In Jesus' time, the Roman Empire ruled many lands, including the land of Judea, where Jesus lived. The Roman official in charge was named Pontius Pilate. We know from other books of the time, that Pontius Pilate was espcially mean and cruel. In the story we are reading today, Pontius Pilate is judging Jesus at a place called the `Praetorium`. He will ultimately sentence him to be crucified. But Jesus will be raised from the dead and ascend back to heaven.
- **Scripture / Read:** Read: `Love One Another: The Last Days of Jesus` by Lauren Thompson
- **Key questions / Discussion points:**  
   - Review the story. Ask the kids to summarize their ideas about it.
   - Review the [Keyword Review Sheet](https://github.com/DukeAtreides/seekonkucc_CommunionClass/blob/main/Handouts/Keywords.md), specifically
     `Love`, `Compassion`, and `Empathy`.
   - Review the [Sayings of Jesus Sheet](https://github.com/DukeAtreides/seekonkucc_CommunionClass/blob/main/Handouts/SayingsOfJesus.md) to show
     how the keywords relate to some of the things Jesus said.
     > Explain how the sayings relate to the keywords.
- **Materials / Supplies:** Poster board, markers, stencils, rulers
- **Activities (step-by-step):** Make the Keyword Poster (Part 1)
   - Firstly, don't rush. There will be time next week to continue this.
   > Please tell the kids that this poster will be displayed at the Communion Celebration, so to work carefully and slowly.
   - This serves as a review of keywords already covered (or some that will be covered later in the curriculum)
   - Use stencils to fill the poster board with keywords.
   - Kids will take turns drawing on the stencils. When possible, could work at the same time. But the idea is to make sure each kid can have a turn drawing the letters.
     > Put `Love` in the biggest letters in the middle
     > Put `Empathy` and `Compassion` in the biggest letters (either top/bottom across or on the sides going downwards).
     > Put the words from the [keyword review sheet](https://github.com/DukeAtreides/seekonkucc_CommunionClass/blob/main/Handouts/Keywords.md)
     > Review the meaning of the words and think of examples as the kids are making the poster.
     > If there is extra space (and I imagine there will be), then add words like `Communion` or `Jesus` or `church`. But please use up the words in the list first - those are core values that everything revolves around.
   - Color the letters if there is time. If not, there's always next week.
- ** Homework **
    > Ask the kids to pick out 2 sayings of Jesus (using the sheet as a suggestion). Write them down on a piece of paper, with the Gospel verse.
    > Then bring their choices back for the next lesson. They will recite one of their choices at the communion celebration, which they will practice (at home) over the next couple of months.
    > The sayings need to come from the Gospels (eg, not from the book of Revelation).
    > The reason for 2 choices is in case kids pick out the same ones.
    > They should pick these out at home with their parents, not in class.

- **Teacher notes / Tips:** This is the activity for the following week too. Also, note the home work
