## Lesson: The Easter Story / Empathy
- **Learning objectives:**
  - Learn the Easter story
  - Learn about empathy, love, compassion
- **Context / Purpose:** 
- **Opening (Say):** 
  > In Jesus' time, the Roman Empire ruled many lands, including the land of Judea, where Jesus lived. The Roman official in charge was named Pontius Pilate. We know from other books of the time, that Pontius Pilate was espcially mean and cruel. In the story we are reading today, Pontius Pilate is judging Jesus at a place called the `Praetorium`. He will ultimately sentence him to be crucified. But Jesus will be raised from the dead and ascend back to heaven.
- **Scripture / Read:** Read: `Love One Another`
- **Key questions / Discussion points:**  
   - Review the story. Ask the kids to summarize their ideas about it.
   - Review the [Keyword Review Sheet](https://github.com/DukeAtreides/seekonkucc_CommunionClass/blob/main/Handouts/Keywords.md), specifically
     `Love`, `Compassion`, and `Empathy`.
- **Materials / Supplies:** Poster board, markers, stencils, rulers
- **Activities (step-by-step):** Make the Keyword Poster (Part 1)
   - Firstly, don't rush. There will be time next week to continue this.
   - This serves as a review of keywords already covered (or some that will be covered later in the curriculum)
   - Use stencils to fill the poster board with keywords.
   - Kids will take turns drawing on the stencils. When possible, could work at the same time. But the idea is to make sure each kid can have a turn drawing the letters.
     > Put `Love` in the biggest letters in the middle
     > Put `Empathy` and `Compassion` in the biggest letters (either top/bottom across or on the sides going downwards).
     > Put other words from the [keyword review sheet](https://github.com/DukeAtreides/seekonkucc_CommunionClass/blob/main/Handouts/Keywords.md)
     > Review the meaning of the words and think of examples as the kids are making the poster.
   - Color the letters if there is time. If not, there's always next week.

- **Teacher notes / Tips:** This is the activity for the following week too.

- **Passport Location:** 
- **TODOs / follow-up:** 
- **Assessment / Closing:** 
- **Home connection / Family activity:**
