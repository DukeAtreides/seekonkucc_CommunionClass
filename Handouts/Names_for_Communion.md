## Names for Communion

From the Seekonk Congregational website: 

> We believe that all people of faith are invited to join Christ at Christ’s table for the sacrament of Communion. Just as many grains of wheat are gathered to make one loaf of bread and many grapes are gathered to make one cup of wine, we, the many people of God, are made one in the body of Christ, the church. The breaking of bread and the pouring of wine reminds us of the costliness of Christ’s sacrifice and the discipleship to which we are all called. In the breaking of bread, we remember and celebrate Christ’s presence among us along with a ‘cloud of witnesses’ – our ancestors, family and friends who have gone before us. It is a great mystery; we claim it by faith.

### Communion: 
  - This means "union with".
  - It signifies a shared participation with Jesus and the entire Christian community when believers partake in the bread and juice (or wine), representing his body and blood.
  - It comes from the Latin `communio` and Greek `koinonia`, both meaning sharing or fellowship, highlighting the mutual bond created through this sacred meal.

### Eucharist: 
  - This means "thanksgiving", reflecting Jesus' words of thanks before breaking the bread and giving the crup at the `Last Supper`.
  - It recalls the Christian practice of giving thanks to God for creation and redemption.

### The Lord's Supper: 
  - The `Lord` is another name for God and also for Jesus.
  - Recalls its institution by Jesus at the `Passover` meal.
  - A piece of furniture that is central to the Lord's Supper is the `Lord's table`, also known as the `altar`, `altar table`, or `communion table`.

### Breaking of Bread: 
  - Jesus broke bread at the `Last Supper`, and then blessed it.
    
### The Body and Blood of Christ
  - At the `Last Supper`, "Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for amany for the forgiveness of sins." (Matthew 26:26–28)
  - Jesus also said, "Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty." (John 6:35)
  - The Church as a whole is also called the `Body of Christ`, and we remember this during `communion` as well.
  - "May You Become What You Eat" is an ancient Christian saying. Just as we symbolically eat Jesus' body, we hope to be transformed into the `Body of Christ` - a people of compassion, hope, joy, and gratitude (thanksgiving).

### Sharing!
 > Note: This is taken from a Christian education handout. Numbers were updated to reflect 2026.
 > Sharing is a part of communion as we say NO to all that destroys individuals and the world, and say YES to what is compassionate, creative, and good. To gather around the `Lord's table` we care deeply about each other and promise to support each other in good times and bad. We also promise to care for God's creatures and to improve a world where [1 in 5 children now lives in extreme poverty](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/publication/child-poverty-global-regional-and-select-national-trends).
