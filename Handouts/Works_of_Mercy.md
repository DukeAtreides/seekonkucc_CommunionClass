### Sacrifice - Giving up something good for the benefit of someone else.
- Doing the works of mercy means that we are making sacrifices of our time and money for others.
- An example: When we have cookies, we might have to make a sacrifice and share them with our brother
- Ashes are a symbol of sacrifice. The minister will put ashes on our foreheads on `Ash Wednesday`.
- Many Christians think about a special sacrifice or make an effort to do something extra (sacrifice of time) during Lent.
