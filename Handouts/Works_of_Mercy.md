## Title: How Kids Can Show God's Love: Works of Mercy and Sacrifice
- As you get older, the kinds of things you do to help people will change. These are ways kids can practice the Works of Mercy.
- It's also really important to graciously receive acts of mercy when someone performs one for you.

### For More Reading
- These are traditional Works of Mercy, slightly modified for kids (eg, `comfort the grieving` is traditionally called `bury the dead`, and from the Methodist works, `stand up for the rights of others` was traditionally `opposition to slavery`).
- Tradition derives these primarily Matthew 25:35-40, but also from the Gospel of Luke, Book of Isaiah, and the Book of Tobit.

### Corporal Works of Mercy (Helping People with Physical Needs)

- Feed the Hungry: Share a cookie with your brother, bring food to the food pantry.
- Give Drink to the Thirsty: Offer your friends a drink when they visit.
- Clothe the Naked: Donate old clothes, share an extra coat if someone is cold.
- Shelter the Homeless: Pray for people who don't have homes, help clean up a park, when you are a litte older even volunteer to build a house with [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/about)
- Visit the Sick: Draw a picture for someone who is sick, call a grandparent.
- Visit the Imprisoned: Pray for people who are far away or in difficult places.
- Comfort the Grieving: Be there for your friends who are sad about losing a pet or a loved one. Pray for those who are sad.

### Spiritual Works of Mercy (Helping People with Their Hearts and Minds)

- Teach Others and Learn From Others: Share what you know, help a friend with their homework. It is also very important to learn things from other people. Teachers are there to help you.
- Counsel the Doubtful: Help a friend who is unsure, give them a hug (if they like hugs).
- Comfort the Sorrowful: Listen when a friend is sad, offer kind words.
- Bear Wrongs Patiently: Be patient when someone is being annoying, try not to get mad.
- Forgive Offenses: Say "It's okay" when someone bumps into you, don't hold grudges.
- Help Friends Make Good Choices: Gently remind friends to be kind.
- Pray for the Living and the Dead: Pray for your family, friends, and people you don't know.

### In addition to the above, the Methodist Christians added these:
- Earning, saving, giving all one can: Give a little money to charity or church each week.
- Stand up for the rights of others: Learn how others are being mistreated, don't cheat people out of things.

### Sacrifice - Giving up something good for the benefit of someone else.
- Doing the works of mercy means that we are making sacrifices of our time and money for others.
- An example: When we have cookies, we might have to make a sacrifice and share them with our brother

### Humility and Repetence
- `Ashes` are a symbol of `sacrifice`, `repentence`, and `humility`. The minister will put ashes on our foreheads on `Ash Wednesday`, which is this coming Wednesday.
- `Repentence` means going from doing the wrong thing to doing the right thing. 
- `Humility`, or being humble, means not thinking you are better than other people even if you are really good at something.
- When thinking of `humility`, think of the `Mirror Rule`:
  - A humble person doesn't spend all day looking at themselves and bragging; they look at others and see how they can help.

### Everyday examples of humility
- Winning a Game: Instead of saying, "I'm the best! You lost!" a humble person says, "Great game! You played really hard!".
- Making a Mistake: Humility means saying "I'm sorry, I was wrong" instead of making excuses or blaming someone else.
- Getting a Compliment: When someone says, "I love your drawing," a humble person says "Thank you!" and might mention how their teacher helped them learn to draw.
- In Line: Letting someone else go first just to be kind, even if you really want to be first. 

### Lenten Sacrifice
- Many Christians think about a special sacrifice or make an effort to do something extra (sacrifice of time) during Lent.
- Making a small sacrifice helps us practice being able to make important sacrifices when we get older.
