## Title: How Kids Can Show God's Love: Works of Mercy and Sacrifice
As you get older, the kinds of things you do to help people will change.
These are ways kids can practice the Works of Mercy.


### For More Reading
- Derived from primarily Matthew 25:35-40.
- But also derive from the Gospel of Luke, Book of Isaiah, and the Book of Tobit.

### Corporal Works of Mercy (Helping People with Physical Needs)

Feed the Hungry: Share a cookie with your brother, bring food to the food pantry.
Give Drink to the Thirsty: Offer your friends a drink when they visit.
Clothe the Naked: Donate old clothes, share an extra coat if someone is cold.
Shelter the Homeless: Pray for people who don't have homes, help clean up a park, when you are a litte older even volunteer to build a house with [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/about)
Visit the Sick: Draw a picture for someone who is sick, call a grandparent.
Visit the Imprisoned: Pray for people who are far away or in difficult places.
Comfort the Grieving: Be there for your friends who are sad about losing a pet or a loved one. Pray for those who are sad.

### Spiritual Works of Mercy (Helping People with Their Hearts and Minds)

Teach the Ignorant and Learn: Share what you know, help a friend with their homework. It is also very important to learn things from other people.
Counsel the Doubtful: Help a friend who is unsure, give them a hug (if they like hugs).
Comfort the Sorrowful: Listen when a friend is sad, offer kind words.
Bear Wrongs Patiently: Be patient when someone is being annoying, try not to get mad.
Forgive Offenses: Say "It's okay" when someone bumps into you, don't hold grudges.
Help Friends Make Good Choices: Gently remind friends to be kind.
Pray for the Living and the Dead: Pray for your family, friends, and people you don't know.

### In addition to the above, the Methodist Christians added these:
- Earning, saving, giving all one can: Give a little money to charity or church each week.
- Stand up for the rights of others: Learn how others are being mistreated, don't cheat people out of things.

### My Lenten Promise!

### Sacrifice - Giving up something good for the benefit of someone else.
- Doing the works of mercy means that we are making sacrifices of our time and money for others.
- An example: When we have cookies, we might have to make a sacrifice and share them with our brother
- Ashes are a symbol of sacrifice. The minister will put ashes on our foreheads on `Ash Wednesday`.
- Many Christians think about a special sacrifice or make an effort to do something extra (sacrifice of time) during Lent.


This Lent, I promise to try my best to:

One Act of Mercy I will do: _________________________
One Sacrifice I will make: _________________________
