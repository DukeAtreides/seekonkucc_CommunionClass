## Lesson — Martin Luther King Jr. and Racism
- **Theme:** Standing up for Peace and Justice like Jesus taught us to do.  
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - Understand the concept of racism and discrimination.  
  - Learn about Martin Luther King Jr. and his role in fighting unjust laws.  
  - Recognize the importance of standing up for the rights of others.  
- **Context / Purpose:** To introduce children to the history of racism in the U.S., the civil rights movement, and the Christian call to justice and equality.  
- **Opening (Say):**  
  > "We talked about Jesus being the light of the world and teaching us to shine our light (goodness) into the world. There is also darkness in the world, people being mean to each other is a symbol of this darkness. Some people are just mean, and some people are ignorant - which means they don’t know any better. Being ignorant  causes them to treat other people as inferior - that’s a fancy way to say, treating them as less important. These people sometimes judge others based on their skin color, and at one time  our country  made laws to hurt African Americans. Hurting others because they do not look like you or think like you is called discrimination and racism. When your grandparents were kids, a Christian pastor named Martin Luther King Jr. stood up to those unjust laws. He gave a famous speech called the 'I Have a Dream' speech. Later, in Memphis, Tennessee, he was killed for his beliefs. We now celebrate his life and what he stood up for every year on MLK  Day which is this weekend. Even though we don’t have those laws anymore, there is still a lot of racism/discrimination in our country today. As Christians, we need to speak up for the rights of other people, especially those who are different from us."
