The directory structure is divided by the Liturgical Season. 
Each lesson can be modular. This makes sense because Lent is variable.
If we structured all the lessons into the calendar year, we'd have to
write a book from the ground up every year to dance around Lent. The other reason
is that when this circuulum was made, we only had the spring semester. In future
years, we might want to move things around. Having a modular lesson plan system
makes a lot of sense to achieve that goal.

# Ok so how does that work?
Each year, all we need to do is create one top level schedule that links
to the lessons. 

Refer to the `md` file that refers to the year.
