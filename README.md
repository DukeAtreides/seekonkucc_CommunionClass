## Lesson 19 : Epiphany - 1/4
### Theme: Light of the World

We discussed what it means to be the light of the world: Compassion, the Golden Rule, and 
using our brains to help out society (using medical advances as an example). 

## Lesson 20 1/11 : Baptism of Jesus
### Theme: Baptism John the Baptist and Sacraments

Hang up photos and dove worksheet on bulletin board
Say: “Last week, we talked about the symbol of light. Today, we talk about baptism, which uses symbols. 
Baptism and Communion are 2 sacraments. A sacrament is a ritual - a symbolic thing people do at church - 
to remember Jesus. Baptism is the sacrament of how people become Christians.” 

Ask- does anyone know what happens at baptism, and who gets baptized? 
Say - “What happens is that the pastor will put water on your head, and say, “I baptize you in the name of 
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit”. A lot of people are baptized as babies, but anyone joining the 
church can be baptized. You are only baptized once. Sometimes people have godparents, or sponsors. In the Service 
of Christian Baptism, WATER stands for the promise of the gift of God’s grace in our lives and being flooded with 
the new life that is experienced through Jesus Christ” (This last sentence comes directly from Seekonk UCC)
Ask: “What does it mean to be a follower of Jesus, that we discussed from last week?”
Answers: Following the Golden Rule of treating others as you would treat them, and showing compassion to the less fortunate.

In Jesus’ time, there were no Christians! Baptism was performed on Jewish adults who followed a prophet named John the Baptist. 
A prophet is someone who gives God’s message. The followers of John the Baptist were waiting for the coming of the Messiah (Jesus), a 
savior who would make the world a better place. Even Jesus was baptized by John.

## Lesson 21 1/18 : Martin Luther King
### Theme: Martin Luther King: Peace Maker, Justice Seeker, Jesus stood up for Justice and this Dream 
Say: “During the past few weeks, we’ve discussed the Golden Rule and being a follower of Jesus at baptism. Can anyone tell me what that 
means?” Golden Rule - Treat other people how you want to be treated, if you were in their shoes.
Say: “We also talked about being the light of the world, and that darkness is a symbol of people being mean to each other. Some people 
are really mean, and some people are ignorant - which means they don’t know any better - and that causes them to treat other people as 
inferior - that’s a fancy way to say, treating them as less important. These people sometimes judge others based on their skin color, 
and in our country, even made laws to hurt African Americans. This is called discrimination and racism. When your grandparents were kids, 
a Christian pastor named Martin Luther King Jr stood up to those unjust laws. He gave a famous speech called the “I have a dream” speech. 
Later, in Memphis Tennessee, he was killed for this, and we celebrate his life this weekend. Even though we don’t have those laws anymore, 
there is still a lot of racism in our country today. As Christians, we need to speak up for the rights of other people, especially those who 
are different from us.”
### Notes for teacher: Specifically saying “when your grandparents were kids”, gives the kids context that racism isn’t some ancient thing, and puts MLK into context. 

Ask the kids to summarize what was just said, and how they feel about it. 

### Read MLK Book

### Activity: ‘We all Love in the same color’:
Trace Children’s hand and arm in different color construction paper
Make a heart large enough for all children to sign their name
Place traced hands on card stock

## Lesson 22 1/25 : The Sermon on the Mount
### Theme: What does God require? The Golden Rule, etc. 
Say: Last week, we talked about Martin Luther King Jr, and how we need to treat other people the right way. We talked about the Golden Rule. What is the Golden Rule?”
Treat other people how you want to be treated, if you were in their shoes.
People followed Jesus on a mountain, where he taught people about God. This is called the Sermon on the Mount. He talked about the Golden Rule. Jesus did not invent the Golden 
Rule, but he taught it. He also taught about helping others. He said, “if you have an extra coat, then give it away to someone who doesn't have one”.

### Read the Kindness Book

### Activity: Stoles
Now, for the fun, we will make stoles. Stoles are used in church to symbolize ministers and other volunteers. It symbolizes following Jesus. We will decorate our stoles with symbols. 

Play Cd music while creating stoles 

Remember Stoles (p.37) (please put name on back at neck area)
put vinyl table cloths down for protection

## Lesson 24 - 2/8/2026  The Feeding of the 5000 
### Theme: Bread and Wine as symbols of spiritual nourishment; and the things we do to nourish our souls
### Read: The Feeding of the Five Thousand,The Children’s Illustrated Bible, page 228
### Context: This next part ties the lesson into Communion, which we are building up to.
Right after the feeding of the 5000, Jesus said: “I am the bread of life...My flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. 
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.”  Then he explained that “The words I have spoken to you—
they are full of the Spirit] and life”. And what that means is that his message of love for one another, following the Golden Rule, 
sharing, thinking of others – those things nourish you and the communities that you live in. Love nourishes your spirit. Think about 
it - when people, especially your family, treat you with love, do you feel nourished? Does it feel good to show love to others? At communion, 
we receive bread and juice that represent Jesus’ body and blood - they represent that we want to live out the Golden Rule. The church itself 
is also called the Body of Christ, and that means that Christians are supposed to work together to treat everyone with kindness. 

### Introduce Social Mission & Action
At our church, we help others. 
A group of people called the Social Mission and Action Committee meets to coordinate our efforts to help people. 
### Visit the porch to show the food pantry where anyone can take food if they need it.
On Saturdays, our church also delivers food to people who need help. We work with a place called Doorways. Doorways is in Seekonk, located at the former North School.
We, as a church, also collect used clothes to give to people who need them.
We, as a church, also help a tiny country called Haiti. 
As a country, the USA also gives food stamps to people who need food. 
As you get older, in these classes, you will learn about ways people need help and how you can help.

## Lesson 25 - 2/15/2026 Sunday Before Lent: The Centurion’s Servant / Works of Mercy / Sacrifice
### Theme: Empathy and helping those who need it; sacrificing for each other. Building up to introduce Lent.
### Read: The Centurion’s Servant pages 218-219
We don’t have power like Jesus did to heal people. We need medicine and doctors. But we can help people who are hurting and in pain. Has anyone heard of 
the term empathy before? Empathy means the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
Ways we can show empathy are through the Corporal and Spiritual works of Mercy.
The Corporal Works of Mercy: 
- To feed the hungry
- To give water to the thirsty
- To clothe the naked
- To shelter the homeless
- To visit the sick
- To visit the imprisoned, or ransom the captive
- To bury the dead.
The Spiritual Works of Mercy:
- To instruct the ignorant
- To counsel the doubtful
- To bear patiently those who wrong oneself
- To forgive offenses
- To comfort the afflicted
- To pray for the living and the dead
- To admonish sinners
Sometimes to do these things, we have to sacrifice something for someone else. When we have cookies,
we might have to make a sacrifice and share them with our brother. A sacrifice is giving up something
that is good for someone else. Lent is next week. That is a time when we make a small sacrifice. That could be
sacrificing our time and doing an extra chore or something nice. It could be giving something up, like chocolate,
to help us practice sacrificing. Do you think you will make a Lenten sacrifice? Lent starts on Ash Wednesday. We
get ashes on our heads. That is a symbol of sacrifice and is supposed to make us think. 
Before we go into Lent and do our sacrifice, there is a big party called Mardi Gras. We will have a Mardi Gras day party today at coffee hour! 
### Discuss: Sacrifice, works of mercy, Lent etc. 
### Explain the Lenten Chain
