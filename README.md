# Communion Class Lesson Plan for Seekonk Congregational Church
## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The directory structure is divided by the Liturgical Season. 
Each lesson can be modular. This makes sense because Lent is variable.
If we structured all the lessons into the calendar year, we'd have to
write a book from the ground up every year to dance around Lent. The other reason
is that when this circuulum was made, we only had the spring semester. In future
years, we might want to move things around. Having a modular lesson plan system
makes a lot of sense to achieve that goal.

# Ok so how does that work?
Each year, all we need to do is create one top level schedule that links
to the lessons. 

Refer to the `md` file that refers to the year.

  5. Discuss sacrifice and Lent
     > Sometimes to do these things, we have to sacrifice something for someone else.
     > When we have cookies, we might have to make a sacrifice and share them with our brother.
     > A sacrifice is giving up something that is good for someone else. Lent is next week.
     > That is a time when we make a small sacrifice. That could be sacrificing our time and doing an extra chore or something nice.
     > It could be giving something up, like chocolate, to help us practice sacrificing. Do you think you will make a Lenten sacrifice?
     > Lent starts on Ash Wednesday. We get ashes on our heads. That is a symbol of sacrifice and is supposed to make us think.
     > Before we go into Lent and do our sacrifice, there is a big party called Mardi Gras. We will have a Mardi Gras day party today at coffee hour!
