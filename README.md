## Lesson 20 1/11 : Baptism of Jesus
### Theme: Baptism John the Baptist and Sacraments

Hang up photos and dove worksheet on bulletin board
Say: “Last week, we talked about the symbol of light. Today, we talk about baptism, which uses symbols. 
Baptism and Communion are 2 sacraments. A sacrament is a ritual - a symbolic thing people do at church - 
to remember Jesus. Baptism is the sacrament of how people become Christians.” 

Ask- does anyone know what happens at baptism, and who gets baptized? 
Say - “What happens is that the pastor will put water on your head, and say, “I baptize you in the name of 
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit”. A lot of people are baptized as babies, but anyone joining the 
church can be baptized. You are only baptized once. Sometimes people have godparents, or sponsors. In the Service 
of Christian Baptism, WATER stands for the promise of the gift of God’s grace in our lives and being flooded with 
the new life that is experienced through Jesus Christ” (This last sentence comes directly from Seekonk UCC)
Ask: “What does it mean to be a follower of Jesus, that we discussed from last week?”
Answers: Following the Golden Rule of treating others as you would treat them, and showing compassion to the less fortunate.

In Jesus’ time, there were no Christians! Baptism was performed on Jewish adults who followed a prophet named John the Baptist. 
A prophet is someone who gives God’s message. The followers of John the Baptist were waiting for the coming of the Messiah (Jesus), a 
savior who would make the world a better place. Even Jesus was baptized by John.

## Lesson 21 1/18 : Martin Luther King
### Theme: Martin Luther King: Peace Maker, Justice Seeker, Jesus stood up for Justice and this Dream 
Say: “During the past few weeks, we’ve discussed the Golden Rule and being a follower of Jesus at baptism. Can anyone tell me what that 
means?” Golden Rule - Treat other people how you want to be treated, if you were in their shoes.
Say: “We also talked about being the light of the world, and that darkness is a symbol of people being mean to each other. Some people 
are really mean, and some people are ignorant - which means they don’t know any better - and that causes them to treat other people as 
inferior - that’s a fancy way to say, treating them as less important. These people sometimes judge others based on their skin color, 
and in our country, even made laws to hurt African Americans. This is called discrimination and racism. When your grandparents were kids, 
a Christian pastor named Martin Luther King Jr stood up to those unjust laws. He gave a famous speech called the “I have a dream” speech. 
Later, in Memphis Tennessee, he was killed for this, and we celebrate his life this weekend. Even though we don’t have those laws anymore, 
there is still a lot of racism in our country today. As Christians, we need to speak up for the rights of other people, especially those who 
are different from us.”
### Notes for teacher: Specifically saying “when your grandparents were kids”, gives the kids context that racism isn’t some ancient thing, and puts MLK into context. 

Ask the kids to summarize what was just said, and how they feel about it. 

### Read MLK Book

## Lesson 22 1/25 : The Sermon on the Mount
### Theme: What does God require? The Golden Rule, etc. 
Say: Last week, we talked about Martin Luther King Jr, and how we need to treat other people the right way. We talked about the Golden Rule. What is the Golden Rule?”
Treat other people how you want to be treated, if you were in their shoes.
People followed Jesus on a mountain, where he taught people about God. This is called the Sermon on the Mount. He talked about the Golden Rule. Jesus did not invent the Golden 
Rule, but he taught it. He also taught about helping others. He said, “if you have an extra coat, then give it away to someone who doesn't have one”.

### Read the Kindness Book

### Activity: Stoles
Now, for the fun, we will make stoles. Stoles are used in church to symbolize ministers and other volunteers. It symbolizes following Jesus. We will decorate our stoles with symbols.
