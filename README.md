     > When we have cookies, we might have to make a sacrifice and share them with our brother.
     > A sacrifice is giving up something that is good for someone else. Lent is next week.
     > That is a time when we make a small sacrifice. That could be sacrificing our time and doing an extra chore or something nice.
     > It could be giving something up, like chocolate, to help us practice sacrificing. Do you think you will make a Lenten sacrifice?
     > Lent starts on Ash Wednesday. We get ashes on our heads. That is a symbol of sacrifice and is supposed to make us think.
     > Before we go into Lent and do our sacrifice, there is a big party called Mardi Gras. We will have a Mardi Gras day party today at coffee hour!
