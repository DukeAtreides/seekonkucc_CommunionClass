## Lesson  — The Feeding of the 5000 / Bread of Life / Social Mission & Action Committee
- **Theme:** Bread and Wine as Symbols of Spiritual Nourishment; Nourishing Our Souls  
- **Learning objectives:**  
  - Explain the symbolism of bread and wine/juice in Communion.  
  - Understand how love and sharing nourish the spirit.  
  - Learn about the church’s role in helping others.
- **Context / Purpose:** To connect the biblical story to Communion and the church’s mission of love and service.
- ** Opening (Say): **
   > "Jesus gave a speech on a mountain, called the Sermon the Mount, where he talked about the Golden Rule".
- **Scripture / Read:** The Feeding of the Five Thousand, The Children’s Illustrated Bible, p.228  
- **Say:**  
  > "Right after the feeding of the 5,000, Jesus said: ‘I am the bread of life... My flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.’ Then he explained that ‘The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.’ That means his message of love for one another, following the Golden Rule, sharing, thinking of others — those things nourish you and the communities you live in. Love nourishes your spirit. This imagery of consuming the words of Jesus are symoblized by bread and grape juice we use in Communion, and what we are celebrating in 2nd grade this year. The symbols of bread and juice are also symbols of spiritual and physical nourishment. When we help other people, we are doing what Jesus did."
