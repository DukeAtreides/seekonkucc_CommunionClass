- **Opening (Say):**
  > "Today, we will discuss leadership, role models, and thinking about who we trust and follow. We will also think about what it means to be a leader. We're going to read a story about when people decided to follow Jesus. When they followed Jesus, they were called `disciples`. Later, after Jesus' rose from the dead, they would become known as the `12 Apostles`.
-  **Scripture / Read:** Jesus Calls His Disciples, The Children’s Illustrated Bible, p.210  
- **Key questions / Discussion points:**  
  - What does it mean to follow Jesus?  
  - Who are your role models? Why?
  - How can you be a good role model for others?  
  - How does critical thinking help us choose who to follow and who to listen to?
  - How do our parents and teachers help us make those decisions?
- **Materials / Supplies:**
  - Paper for tracing foot prints
  - Crayons/markers
  - Tape
- **Activities (step-by-step):** Role Model Walk
  - Each child traces each of their feet on a piece of paper.
  - Each child decorates 2–4 paper footprints.
  - On each footprint they write or draw:
    - One way they can follow Jesus (be kind, share, pray, help) OR
    - one role model they want to follow (mom, dad, Jesus, teacher)
  - Create a Path: Attach footprints on wall or bulletin board, maybe leading from their doves.
- **Teacher notes / Tips:**  
  - Encourage children to think about their own role models.  
  - Use the game to reinforce disciples’ names and roles.
  - If kids name a famous person as a role model, try to really press them as to why, and see if there's better alternative. Eg: Taylor Swift or a football player.
